Project Title: Java Bank Management System

Project Description:
Create a Java application for managing bank accounts and transactions. Users should be able to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, and view transaction history.

Functional Requirements:

User Registration:

Allow customers to register by providing their name, address, and initial deposit amount.
Generate a unique account number for each customer.
Account Management:

Implement different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking).
Allow customers to deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts.
Calculate and display account balances.
Provide an option to close an account.
Transaction History:

Maintain a transaction history for each account, including date, transaction type (deposit/withdrawal), and amount.
Admin Panel:

Implement an admin panel for bank staff to manage customer accounts.
Admins should be able to view all accounts, search for accounts by name or account number, and close accounts if necessary.
Technical Implementation:

Use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to model customers, accounts, and transactions as Java classes.

Use data structures like ArrayLists or HashMaps to store and manage customer accounts and transaction records.

Implement a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) for customers and the admin panel.

Use exception handling to handle errors gracefully, such as insufficient funds during withdrawals.

Implement proper data validation to ensure the integrity of customer information and transactions.
